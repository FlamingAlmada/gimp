gimp grid shown per image instead of global:
	works, but the toggle action at View > Show Grid no longer reflects the current state.
	that's because there should be an event handling for when the current image changes to adjust that.
	Not that I care, as the idea is to remove that command from there and add it into a dockable.

	relevant files:
		display/gimpcanvasgrid -> where grid drawing is made
		core/gimpgrid -> where new property was set. If one is set here, it is automatically saved on the xcf
		widgets/gimpgrideditor -> UI for "Image > Configure Greedo"
		dialogs/grid-dialog -> big level of indirection. Creates the GTK window but delegates actual contruction to the widget
		actions/view-commands -> the actual handler for the "View > Show Greedo" toggle action


gimp docks locking shortcut button on the dock:
	missing visual cue by icon swap

cool snippets

	g_warning ("%s: UI manager '%s' has now widget at path '%s'",
					 G_STRFUNC, dialog_ui_manager->name, dialog_ui_path);
